<p> This is the repository for the University of Essex's African and Caribbean Society (ACS) website.</p>

<h3><strong>Future improvements and additions:</strong></h3>

<p> A more distinctive visual presentation and user experience is continually ongoing.</p>

<p> Improvements to the event section (in particular the addition of a register interest  and intent from memebers to attend an event), a social space/section and page that connects with (in hyperlinks and content) African and Caribbean Society's from other universities are a few things I am hoping to add soon.
